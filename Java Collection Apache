ingest a recipe.txt file and store this information in a Java Collection of your choice. You will need to use the Apache Commons CSV project to parse the text file. 
When parsing the text file, you should store the data in the following POJO:

create “endpoints” inside of a RestController that will filter this data:

The “all-recipes” endpoint will not filter the data at all and should return the full Collection.

The “gluten-free” endpoint will only return a subset of the full Collection where glutenFree is true

The “vegan” endpoint will only return a subset of the full Collection where vegan is true

The “vegan-and-gluten-free” endpoint will only return a subset of the full Collection where glutenFree is true and vegan is true

The “vegetarian” endpoint will only return a subset of the full Collection where vegetarian is true
